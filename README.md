# SeaPort911
2020 Hackathon submission for the SeaPort Project team

The team used our project's BitBucket server as a repository during development, there will be one main commit to this repository when complete.

## Installation Instructions:
The SeaPort911 Chat Bot was built to be added onto the existing SeaPort web application. While we made a standalone project for the purposes of demonstrating the bot's functionality in the Hackathon, installation would be including it into the SeaPort web app's source code and following the deployment process used for the project.
